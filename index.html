        <p>Hi. My name is Onavino Ajenavi and I am from Delta, Nigeria. I am a student of BYU Idaho. I am a
            student at both Brigham Young University (BYU) Idaho, studying web and computer programming online, and
            Delta state University (Delsu),
            studying Electrical Electronics Engineering on campus. As a student of Delsu, I am currently in year 3
            of my 5 year academic calender. My projected graduation time is 2027, which is fast approaching. I will be
            graduating with a bachelors degree in Electrical Electronics Engineering. I also expect to be graduating
            from BYU Idaho wityh a bachelors degree in Software Development. I have passion for Engineering and I wish
            to improve
            myself however possible in that field. I also love music, movies and literature as it tends to give me
            another beauutiful view of life other than ones and zeros.</p>
